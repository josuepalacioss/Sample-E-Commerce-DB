# Sample-E-Commerce-DB
Developed as part of a course project focused on relational database design and normalization. The project involved designing and implementing the backend database for a sample e-commerce website, where users could browse products organized into Men’s, Women’s, and Luxury categories.

Key Features
  Relational Schema Design: Created a normalized database schema adhering to 3rd Normal Form (3NF) and Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) to eliminate data redundancy and maintain data integrity.

  Category Segmentation: Watches were categorized under distinct tabs (Men's, Women's, Luxury) to simulate real-world e-commerce navigation.

  Sample Web Integration: Connected the database to a provided sample website template to visually display products and validate database functionality.

  Optimized Data Structure: Ensured efficient querying, scalability, and ease of future updates through proper use of foreign keys and indexed attributes.

Learning Outcomes
  Gained practical experience in relational database modeling and normalization.

  Learned how to prevent anomalies in data insertion, deletion, and updates.

  Developed skills in building normalized schemas that support clear data relationships and scalable architecture.
